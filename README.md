# Moire Plasma Effect

A nice [plasma effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_effect)
using [moir√© patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern).
You can watch it here:

Animated using CSS;
two patterns of slightly wavy parallel diagonal lines
continuously slide across the screen in orthogonal directions (NW and NE).

The patterns are generated by GIMP 2.8.10
using Script-Fu (TinyScheme version 1.40);
see the makefile.

Earlier, I created something similar in Scratch:
