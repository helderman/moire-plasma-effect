Moir&eacute; Plasma Effect

by Ruud Helderman

Welcome to this demonstration of the Moir&eacute; Plasma Effect.
The background animation on this page is pure CSS;
there is NO JavaScript involved.
Best viewed on Google Chrome;
or possibly another WebKit-based browser (Safari).
Looks glitchy on IE and Firefox; quite a disappointment!

Never mind; I just wanted to prove the potential of moir&eacute; patterns.
Googling around revealed little more than
boring black-and-white textbook examples,
so I decided to do some experimenting myself in 2015.
I was surprised to find you could even use more than one color.
I wonder if anyone ever seriously investigated this stuff;
please drop me a line if you know of any such research.

Despite my age, I was never involved in the demoscene.
But I wanted to keep this demo in style, hence this simple scroller.
Thanks everyone, be good, play nice, don't drink and drive, blah blah,
and so long.
