This project uses moiré patterns to mimic a plasma effect. This technique has its pros and cons.

Advantages:
- Smooth animation; under Scratch, the use of sprites and transparency outperforms traditional brute-force pixel manipulations.
- Simple code; the complexity is in the images.

Disadvantages:
- Visible 'fabric' (thin black horizontal lines).
- Low contrast.
- Very sensitive to scaling; any non-integer scaling factor may ruin the effect.

The moiré patterns were created using GIMP (http://www.gimp.org). Solid noise was applied as a displacement map to a pattern of black and white horizontal lines; the resulting pattern was used as the alpha channel in an otherwise black image.

BUGS:
Looks terrible when run in full-screen mode; apparently the graphical scaling emphasizes the 'fabric' lines.
Looks terrible when run with the Stage3D engine (i.e. in a project that uses certain graphics effects - see http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Stage3D); it appears the bottom part of a sprite gets blurred, possibly due to misaligned scan lines.
